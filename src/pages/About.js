    <p>
      I am a talented, ambitious and hardworking individual, 
      with broad skills and experience in digital and printed 
      marketing, social media and leading projects.
      Furthermore, I am adept at handling multiple tasks on a 
      daily basis competently and at working well under pressure.
      A key strength is communication; building strong 
      relationships with people in order to deliver the best 
      results.
